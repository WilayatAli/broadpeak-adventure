                <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
                <p>Broad Peak Adventures lays out its terms and conditions governing various services, including trips, trekking, mountaineering, hiking, rafting, wild safaris, and other operations conducted by the company. These terms and conditions serve to provide clarity and establish guidelines for individuals interested in participating in the offered programs.</p>

                <div class="tremsAndConditionDetails">
                    <h4>Reservation Process:</h4>
                    <p class="texts">A 30 to 50% advance payment is required at least one month prior to the trip or upon confirmation to secure the booking. This advance payment signifies the client's commitment to the trip and allows the company to manage necessary documents, permissions, and field staff.
                    Full payment settlement is mandatory before clients embark on the trip or utilize any of the company's services upon arrival in Pakistan.
                    <p class="texts">The advance payment is non-refundable in the event of trip cancellation by the client.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p class="texts">Refunds for the advance payment are only applicable if the company encounters technical obstacles preventing the trip from proceeding.
                        No refunds are provided for the 40% deposit amount in case of delayed arrival, no-show, or trip cancellation for any other reason.
                        </p>
                    <p class="texts">Any queries or concerns regarding the terms outlined can be addressed through bilateral negotiation between Broad Peak Adventures and the client.</p>
                    <p class="texts">Advance payments can be directly deposited into the company's bank account through any bank worldwide</p>

                    <p class="texts">Refunds are not provided for cancellations resulting in a deposit loss. Full refunds are available for client-initiated cancellations, though cancellation charges do apply.</p>
                    <h4>Supplement Charge: </h4>
                    <p class="texts">A single room supplement charge is applicable if a roommate is unavailable for shared accommodations.</p>

                    <p class="texts">No refunds are issued for any unused portions of the itinerary if a client chooses to drop out of the tour.</p>
                    <h4>Client Responsibility:  </h4>
                    <p class="texts">Clients are expected to respect the authority of the tour guide. Any unlawful behavior may result in expulsion from the tour without refund.</p>
                    <h4>Impact on Your Journey:  </h4>
                    <p class="texts">While we strive to ensure comfortable travel, it's important to recognize that facilities in Asian countries may differ from those in western countries. Additionally, weather conditions can impact the journey. Therefore, patience, enthusiasm, and adequate preparation are essential.</p>
                    <h4>Travel Insurance:  </h4>
                    <p class="texts">We strongly recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance to cover medical emergencies, natural disasters, evacuation, accidents, and trip cancellations.</p>
                    <h4>Tour Amendment:  </h4>
                    <p class="texts">Prior notice is required for any alterations to the tour itinerary. However, changes may occasionally be necessary en route due to circumstances such as inclement weather. Please note that all itineraries are subject to change.</p>
                    <h4>Papers and Documents: </h4>
                    <p class="texts">Clients are responsible for ensuring all necessary documents are presented in a timely manner, including visas and permits.</p>

                    <h4>Risk and Responsibility: </h4>
                    <p class="texts">Your safety and enjoyment are our top priorities. However, please be aware that circumstances such as landslides, political unrest, or adverse weather conditions may necessitate changes to the itinerary. Any additional costs incurred as a result are the responsibility of the client.</p>

                    <h4>Flight Delay/Cancellation: </h4>
                    <p class="texts">Flight delays or cancellations, particularly during the off-season, are possible. It is advisable to reserve extra days to accommodate potential delays. Any costs associated with accommodation and meals due to canceled flights are the responsibility of the client.</p>
